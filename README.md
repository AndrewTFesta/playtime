Notes and important documentation I've picked up while working with various libraries on various projects, or even jsut playing around..

## Datasets

[Setup and installation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/installation)

I primarily use pytorch, but you can use either pytorch or tensorflow.

```
pip install datasets
python -c "from datasets import load_dataset; print(load_dataset('squad', split='train')[0])"
```
```
{
  'answers': {
    'answer_start': [515],
    'text': ['Saint Bernadette Soubirous']
  },
  'context': 'Architecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop the Main Building\'s gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend "Venite Ad Me Omnes". Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.',

}
```

### Audio

`pip install datasets[audio]`

`python -c "import soundfile; print(soundfile.__libsndfile_version__)"`

> To support loading audio datasets containing MP3 files, users should additionally install torchaudio, so that audio data is handled with high performance.

`pip install torchaudio`

> torchaudioâ€™s `sox_io` backend supports decoding mp3 files. Unfortunately, the sox_io backend is only available on Linux/macOS, and is not supported by Windows.

> Audio datasets commonly have an `audio` and `path` or `file` column.

> `audio` is the actual audio file that is loaded and resampled on-the-fly upon calling it.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset, load_metric, Audio

common_voice = load_dataset("common_voice", "tr", split="train")

audio = common_voice[0]["audio"]
audio_path = common_voice[0]["path"]
```

> When you access an audio file, it is automatically decoded and resampled. Generally, you should query an audio file like: `common_voice[0]["audio"]`. If you query an audio file with `common_voice["audio"][0]` instead, all the audio files in your dataset will be decoded and resampled. This process can take a long time if you have a large dataset.

> The path is useful if you want to load your own audio dataset. In this case, provide a column of audio file paths to [Dataset.cast_column()](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.2.1/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.cast_column):

`my_audio_dataset = my_audio_dataset.cast_column("paths_to_my_audio_files", Audio())`

#### Resample

Some models expect the audio data to have a certain sampling rate due to how the model was pretrained. For example, the XLSR-Wav2Vec2 model expects the input to have a sampling rate of 16kHz, but an audio file from the Common Voice dataset has a sampling rate of 48kHz. You can use Dataset.cast_column() to downsample the sampling rate to 16kHz:

`common_voice = common_voice.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16_000))`

### Vision

`pip install datasets[vision]`

## Pipelines

`pip install -i https://pypi.org/simple/ bitsandbytes`

> If the model is too large for a single GPU and you are using PyTorch, you can set device_map="auto" to automatically determine how to load and store the model weights. Using the device_map argument requires the ðŸ¤— Accelerate package.
